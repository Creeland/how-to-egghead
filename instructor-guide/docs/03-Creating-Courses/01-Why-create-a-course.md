## Why create a course
After you've created 5 or so stand-alone lessons, it will be time to start discussing your first course.

Courses are the bread and butter of egghead.

A course is a composed set of bite-sized lessons. The course itself should be bite-sized, covering a single topic in depth through a sequence of individual lessons.

The lessons in a course can be enjoyed and understood solo—but together, those lessons allow learners to follow a collective thread and understand a topic in much more depth.

A course will include:

- a robust summary that can include links to pre-requisites and other resources
- a list of all the other lessons in the course
- course notes in the form of a GitBook the community can build together
- an "enhanced transcript" that assembles all of the transcripts for a course into a usable document that allows the learner to read the entire course as a book
- the code for each lesson representing its current state, with a readme describing how to execute the code if it isn't embedded.
- individual lesson summaries with links, etc.

If that sounds like a lot of work, that’s because it *is*. Each lesson takes a lot of effort, so a course amounts to the effort for all the lessons you need to create, and then a little more.

But the payoff is worth it. Why?


### egghead members love them

Humans love curated knowledge. They want to learn a topic in depth, but at a pace that works for them.

egghead courses give hungry learners a sequence to follow, with the promise of greater understanding at the end of ~8–12 lessons. We’ve found that developers are willing to sit down and watch courses—and pay for them.

Which brings us to our next point...


### You make more money!

No two ways about it, courses get more eyeballs than individual lessons. It just makes sense: When you publish courses, you publish several lessons at a time. That’s more content and more chances for views.

Not only that: Learners often watch those lessons consecutively. (Obviously. That’s what a course is meant for.)

Once your course is published, it can continue to create a passive revenue stream for you. Learners will keep watching, and the royalties will keep coming in.


### You want to do more with your code

When you’re going through the process of crafting a lesson—creating your [code example](#create-your-code-example) and using the [“show your work” trick](#the-show-your-work-trick)—you might need to cut out some cool information. Either because it’s off-topic, or because it widens the scope of your lesson way beyond 10 minutes.

Never fear, courses are here.

Turn that excess info into a string of lessons, and you’ll have yourself a course. A course will take one code example and use a few different diffs to show different concepts. If you’re feeling hamstrung by the bite-sized nature of individual lessons, courses give you a little more room to play and showcase what you know.

# 07 - Maintain your course
Ever heard of "JavaScript fatigue"? ðŸ˜«

Well, it affects egghead.io courses. Video is a tough format, and because libraries move at a brisk pace and forward progress is always happeningâ€”which is great!â€”egghead content producers have some specific challenges in keeping courses current and usable.


## Updates from our review team

Our egghead content team works hard to keep your course as viable as possible, as long as possible. Every day, they review courses on egghead.io to confirm the code and examples are relevant and still work.

Same with our lessons. The content team reviews lessons to confirm they still function with the latest versions of the tools they cover. When updates are needed, our team updates the code and attaches version labels to help students understand the differences between the lesson video and the code.


## When itâ€™s time for big changes

Time marches on. Libraries and frameworks get updated. Sometimes, that means courses become outdated or irrelevant. (This is why we created egghead in the first placeâ€”to help developers learn quickly because things change *all the time*.)

If this is the case for your course, the content team will notify you so you can update the lessons on your end. That is, if you want to. But we must say, it's definitely in your best interest to keep your course updated, especially right when progress happens. Thereâ€™s no better time to stake your claim to knowledge. Relevance pays off. ðŸ’°

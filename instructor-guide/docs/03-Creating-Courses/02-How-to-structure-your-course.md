# 02 - How to structure your course
*Illustration note: I’m at a loss for how to explain these concepts visually.* @Maggie A *, any ideas?*

There are several types of egghead courses. The most important aspects of a course are tight focus and high-quality examples. If you have those two things, the style doesn't matter. 

But it always helps to have a plan, and you might benefit from having a set format to guide you. These course types are excellent places to start.


## Documentation 

*[Illustration: a piece of paper?]*

This type of course is a straightforward presentation of the documentation for a library, framework, or tool. Dan Abramov's [popular course on Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux) is a great example. 

A documentation presentation doesn't mean you simply read the docs to the student. Instead, take the docs and present them with high-quality examples. 


## Project-based

*[project-based illustration]*

Another favorite is a project-based approach. In this case, the course amounts to a project that the student will build from start to finish. 

Our cofounder John Lindquist did this with his [Build Redux Style Applications course](https://egghead.io/courses/build-redux-style-applications-with-angular-rxjs-and-ngrx-store), using Angular, RxJS, and ngrx/store as its bases.


## Cookbook

You can also present a series of problems and solutions in the "cookbook" style. A typical recipe will include some common (or maybe not-so-common) problems, and then provide an example solution for the problem using the tool the cookbook is discussing. 

Trevor D. Miller's [React Testing Cookbook](https://egghead.io/courses/react-testing-cookbook) course is a solid example of this approach.


## You decide!

You're smart and creative, and definitely not limited to any of these course types. If you've got an idea for a new way to structure your course, let's hear it!

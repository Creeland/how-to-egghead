## Record your course
With all the prep you've already done for your course, a lot of the hard work is behind you.

Once your proposal has been reviewed and approved, you can spend some time **iterating your lesson plans on paper** and building a solid curriculum that will be useful for thousands of developers for years to come!

When you’re ready, record your lessons and upload them one by one as they’re finished.

And you know what? That’s all recording a course is: recording individual lessons that the egghead team will bundle together on egghead.io. By now, you’re an expert lesson-creator, but feel free to read our [guidelines to recording lessons](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/03-Record-your-lesson-5sBpHCVOxhPhlZYEVxrhY) should you need a refresher.

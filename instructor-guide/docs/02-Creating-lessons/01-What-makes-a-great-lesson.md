## What makes a great lesson?

*Illustration note: instead of links to lessons, embed the the videos.*

Imagine calling a coworker over to your desk to show them something cool you just learned. Would you make a slide deck? Use star-dissolve transitions? Nah, you‚Äôd just dive right in.

That‚Äôs what egghead learners want you to do. They‚Äôre looking for concise, efficient information that respects their time and shows them how to do something. Nothing fancy, just badass.

In the spirit of show, don‚Äôt tell, this free course by egghead cofounder John Lindquist shows what makes a great lesson: [Record Badass Screencasts for egghead](https://egghead.io/courses/record-badass-screencasts-for-egghead-io)


### It‚Äôs focused

An egghead lesson discusses a single topic. Don‚Äôt stray‚Äîstay on point and be concise.

Learners should walk away with a better understanding of the concept covered in the lesson. In just a few minutes, they should increase their vocabulary and learn through a high-quality example.

### Its title and summary are precise

Writing concise titles and summaries is the best way to narrow the scope of your lesson so it‚Äôs hyper-focused on a single topic. (They‚Äôre also the best way to cash‚Äîand we mean cash‚Äîin on search terms. Mentioning relevant technologies = SEO = üí∞)

Your summary should quickly tell learners what they‚Äôll gain from your lesson. You could start by writing, ‚ÄúIn this lesson, you will learn to...‚Äù One or two sentences are üëå

Your title is the summary of your summary. It should finish the thought, ‚ÄúHow do I...‚Äù

### The code example is simple and effective

[The code example](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/05-Create-your-code-example-cDZZONYRKCLyHsIKaIuSY) is arguably the most important part of a lesson. The learner should be able to look at the difference between the *before* and *after* code to understand how you‚Äôve applied the concept in the lesson.

If your example is airtight, it will do the instructing for you. Your narration will just serve to support it. Use the [‚Äúshow your work‚Äù trick](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/08-The-show-your-work-trick-LSi5Afd81Ougalm84MYWe) to see if you‚Äôve shown enough.

### It cuts intros, outros, and stage-setting

**No** ‚Äúhi, my name is.‚Äù **No** ‚Äúin the previous lesson we learned about...‚Äù Each lesson should exist on its own without any stage-setting‚Äîjust like this video:

This video doesn't talk about the chicken recipe it covered for the dinner course. It doesn‚Äôt explain why you may need a cheesecake-stuffed cookie cake. (Attending a party? Stress-baking?) It doesn‚Äôt explain what sugar, cookie dough, and ovens are for the .00001% of the population that don‚Äôt already know. It just jumps right in.

When creating your lessons, assume your viewers have working knowledge of the topics covered or will pause the video to learn on their own time. Don‚Äôt waste time in your lesson reinventing the wheel (or explaining what wheels are and why they‚Äôre helpful).

### It guides the eyes

Your audience is trying to follow what you're saying. It's crucial that you keep them with you by guiding their eyes.

Highlight the area of the screen you're teaching. Use the mouse to select/click/drag or anything that creates a sense of movement to tell them "You should be looking here!" Remember, this is a video, they're here for the movement, so keep it movin'!

# 01 - Why be an instructor? 
We get it. The last thing you need is another commitment. (You probably see the word ‚Äúcommit‚Äù in your sleep.) Good news: egghead instructors have zero obligations. It‚Äôs a lowkey side hustle that can seriously pay off.


## You get paid

egghead instructors [get paid](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/07-Getting-paid-FRoGSwr8LPNxoyd6ViWiE) every time someone watches one of your published lessons. More accurately, we pay you monthly based on your views for the preceding month. We market our content quite a bit, but feel free to share your lessons widely.

The more content you publish, the more money you‚Äôre likely to make. [More on payment](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/07-Getting-paid-FRoGSwr8LPNxoyd6ViWiE).


## You‚Äôre an expert

You heard us! You‚Äôre an expert. egghead instructors aren‚Äôt necessarily senior developers or technology directors (though some are). They‚Äôre just people who love writing code. You‚Äôre an expert when you share knowledge other people are looking for. So share it!


## Cement your knowledge

Explaining something helps you understand it better. If you‚Äôre learning a new skill or framework, there‚Äôs no better way to nail it than to record yourself talking about it (and re-record and edit until the holes in your logic disappear). Pop quiz yourself and make some money while you‚Äôre at it.


## Make career moves

egghead instructor looks üëç on a resume. Published lessons are portfolio gold. egghead gives you a platform‚Äîand all you need to do is give your knowledge a voice. We‚Äôll amplify it for you.

## Get egghead.io access for life

Here‚Äôs a serious perk: Every egghead instructor gets a lifetime membership to egghead.io with access to all of our premium lessons and courses. That‚Äôs a lot of learning to do, with lots more to come.


## Work with good people

You should always do your due diligence before partnering with any organization. But we give you our word: egghead is a low-key company whose sole focus is making web developers better at what they do. 

Most of us at egghead HQ are developers too, so we know how busy you are. [We‚Äôll support you](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/03-Meeting-your-coach-48kv2z4NI0EXDNAAdxN09), we won‚Äôt give you deadlines (seriously‚Äîyou produce content only when you want to), and we‚Äôll [pay you](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/07-Getting-paid-FRoGSwr8LPNxoyd6ViWiE) fairly and quickly. Honestly, egghead is the company we always wanted to work with, so we created it for ourselves and for all the smart, badass developers out there.

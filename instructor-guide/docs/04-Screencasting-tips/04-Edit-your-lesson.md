## Edit your lesson
Editing is your lesson’s critical last stop between you and your audience. It’s your quality filter.


### Ripple delete

⚡️Ripple delete is your greatest ally. ⚡️ It’s basically deleting the bad parts, a chunk of seconds at a time—like that tangent you go on, that five-second period where you stammer over a word, and those dozens of “umm”s and “like”s you had no idea you said so often. Ripple delete couldn’t be easier or more essential, and it’s available in both Camtasia and Screenflow. 🙌

In the egghead lesson shown below, John Lindquist shows how he uses ripple delete to trim a video from 7:28 to 2:17. Yes, really.

### Editing with Premiere

In time, you can 💥 kick it up a notch 💥 with more sophisticated editing software like Adobe Premiere. Premiere has some significant advantages, but it also has a steep learning curve. We recommend starting simple, and leveling up to a non-linear editing system like Premiere later. If you’re interested, see how some of our advanced instructors use Premiere:

### The easiest way to edit is to capture it well

In traditional videography, “in-camera editing” refers to the idea of capturing content so well, it doesn’t need to be edited much at all.

Your first few lessons will feel like a major effort to produce because you have to consider so many different things. You’re teaching complex concepts (web development) and learning complex concepts (screencasting) at the same time.

Believe us: You’ll get better. And better. And better. Just keep practicing and keep recording.

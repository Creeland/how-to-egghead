# Prepare your screen for recording

**Success on egghead comes down to mechanics**. This guide will help you nail the technical aspects of presentation and accessibility, so you can present lessons that are visually clear and accessible for all learners and devices.

Screencasting isn‚Äôt easy. It‚Äôs a difficult skill to nail‚Äîand on top of that, we‚Äôre very picky about the screencasts we publish on egghead.io. We can‚Äôt publish screencasts with small fonts, blurry text, and low-contrast color schemes that distract from learning. While egghead screencasts are diverse, they must also share a sameness of quality and presentation.

Watch this video on removing distractions:

<ResponsiveEmbed src="https://egghead.io/lessons/tools-remove-distractions/embed" />

**Always remember accessibility.** A wide range of people will access your lessons on a variety of devices of varying quality. Maximizing the legibility of the code you present helps all learners absorb the information to the best of their abilities.

### Set your settings

Before you do anything else, adopt these settings:

- 1280x720 (720p)
- 16:9 aspect ratio
- Stereo audio ([you‚Äôll set up your audio next](/set-up-your-audio))
- For best results, use HiDPI mode on your monitor

We deliver content at 720p (1280x720 in pixels). We want this to be a crisp and legible output for the viewer, whether they‚Äôre expanding lessons fullscreen on a 65" TV screen or watching them on the bus.

This video shows you how to prepare the screen and mic to do just that

<ResponsiveEmbed src="https://egghead.io/lessons/tools-prepare-to-record-screen-resolution-and-mic-check/embed" />

HiDPI mode‚Äîalso known broadly as DPI scaling, or Retina display on Macs‚Äîdoubles each pixel, allowing for highly readable text on very high-resolution screens. Use it if possible!

### DPI scaling on Windows

On Windows, we've had success boosting the code fonts to max out the screen. Aspect ratio is key here, so set your screen to the highest 16x9 resolution and kick the fonts up.

Using DPI scaling features is helpful‚Äîyou can scale the OS chrome and make UI more legible.

[This article](http://www.eizoglobal.com/support/compatibility/dpi_scaling_settings_windows/) can tell you more about pixel scaling on Windows.

### Access HiDPI mode on macOS

On Mac, you‚Äôll get the best results if you record at **1280x720(HiDPI) mode**. This resolution is achievable on 27" monitors and Retina MBPs. It effectively gives you a visible resolution of 1280x720, but it‚Äôs extremely crisp and readable on phones and tablets.

This mode is "hidden" by default. You can achieve it on a Mac with a software tool that exposes the option, like the **RDM tool**. On Retina MacBooks, the option works automatically. For external monitors, or non-Retina Macs, follow these instructions to enable HiDPI mode:

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/IzTyjUaF9aGg3L1yGjJQ_qMtL7SzlX-r_zJaF4A6iFMipGXhtFt_jJlpn16oDEj3QdTiOIOnmW6h2WIv1jO3PQrzfIxxYbloXcnncNjTFGpCre1ieaTTgMYKiRxAGFHJRH3Lst0r)

Another application that works well is [**SwitchRezX**](http://www.madrau.com/). It's shareware and requires a fee. If you can't use this mode, recording at normal **1280x720** or **2560x1440** are workable substitutes.

By constraining to this small window, you can fill the screen effectively for coding screencasts. The most import thing to get correct is the aspect ratio. We don't want to present with any black bars around the screen. We want to give the user maximum code visibility at all times.

### Screen and code layout

The code is the champion of an egghead.io screencast, so it must be comfortably readable for all learners.

- **Maximum space:** Give your code maximum horizontal space by using an 80- or 120-character "column" for the code and bumping the font size up to fit.
- **Padding:** Allow some padding for the top and bottom of the recording window, which could get cut off by Player Chrome. For instance, if you're recording the terminal, commands toward the bottom might not be visible. You don‚Äôt want to frustrate or distract your viewers.
- **3-column layout:** We will typically work in a 3-column layout, with the editor taking up 2/3s and a browser on the right side in the remaining 1/3 of the screen. You might prefer to flip back and forth between the browser and the editor‚Äîup to you!

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/yFu1UkYEzFM_zbwuf6kxZU5WuUwc_zhkaJY6uDSwk32Tega5Mj6rNukMByPiNZseZVyQgxPcRVsB07yh5R6IkiBUHnkm4mtAB9XOGJ4wt3qX0ZYcKw1kTVp0VJ-qNb9wJyctddH4)

We prefer this 2:1 ratio of code:example. It will look something like:

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/uKXJLKCjIN0VsNGGKt8TmUfm_wwUrtBIJcUMYWFMWxbyN2B-zc_NvvWetSZDZ8a3oSj9fby0mwXDt26a5FNz1eC3U8ad48JaO0oiwYB8rey9DB3yJBITT0O6Y-FFSIi9cwsZk1S5)

Notice that the code's font size has been increased to **maximize the space available.**

Place your **example on the right**, occupying 1/3rd of the screen. Consider that your example will need to fit in that space when you‚Äôre creating it. Choose a simple example with a minimally responsive layout, and you‚Äôll be just fine.

In some cases, the example is replaced by a terminal, or a terminal window shares the right column with the example. In this latter case, the terminal window would be on the bottom-right section of your screen.

Remember that your lesson viewers are here to see the code. Make it the starring feature!

#### Visual Studio Code settings

If you are using VSCode, egghead instructor [Andy Van Slaars](https://twitter.com/avanslaars) has put together a [GitHub repo with a screencasting profile](https://github.com/avanslaars/code-profiles) that loads the settings he uses when recording screencasts.

Here are some more settings that help remove some of the distractions:

```
"editor.minimap.enabled": false,
"explorer.confirmDragAndDrop": false,
"editor.fontSize": 18,
"terminal.integrated.fontSize": 18,
"workbench.activityBar.visible": false,
"editor.quickSuggestions": false,
"editor.suggestOnTriggerCharacters": false,
"editor.wordBasedSuggestions": false,
"editor.quickSuggestionsDelay": 1000000,
"editor.parameterHints.enabled": false
```

### Command line prompt

If you will be showing your command line, we suggest using a minimal prompt to reduce distractions. This example prompt works well for screencasting:

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TouVkaQl8WDHTdHxr-u8PiALhO8MVjuOm1m05dtK6k8s2BPbcNDJe6pPH7Q0YXpVBUE0gH5ykLFbYq5VXGghJ---2FrdBhnRi5iGUQSA3Cdfxa2ohb-GfOXIGrTq0S1FKOVsD1wd)

You can use this one by updating your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` with the following:

```bash
export PS1="\n\[\e[32m\]\W\n\[\e[m\]\[\e[34m\]\\$\[\e[m\]"
```

Note: If you‚Äôre on Mac and using Bash, you also need to add a `~/.bash_profile` with this:

`source $HOME/.bashrc`

This tells Mac to load your `~/.bashrc` when loading a terminal emulator.

Now that your screen is ready to record, sound up. Time to get your audio ready.

# Set up your audio

Good audio starts with quality gear. Your laptop‚Äôs built-in microphone sounds decent, but we want you to sound way better than decent.

When you become an egghead instructor, we hook you up! As soon as you have a draft lesson almost ready to publish, we‚Äôll send you a waterproof Pelican case full of professional-grade audio recording equipment. üì¨

![photo of open case with egghead gear inside](./images/audio-setup/open-case.jpg)

Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll be getting:

- K & M 23150-500-55 tabletop microphone stand with 5/8" threaded connector and mini boom arm
- Shure BETA 87A microphone
- Shock mount to attach the mic to the stand
- Shure X2U XLR-to-USB signal adapter
- 1 XLR cable to connect the microphone to the USB interface
- Badass by Kathy Sierra (to inspire your great ideas)

![all the contents layed out to view](./images/audio-setup/all-contents.jpg)

Let‚Äôs go through each piece of equipment and explain how you‚Äôll use it.

### Microphone boom

![photo of microphone boom](./images/audio-setup/stand.jpg)

The boom is a stand for your mic. Booms can range in size and shape. (Action movies require bigger booms than egghead lessons.) This is a very nice, sturdy boom from Germany that folds down for easy storage in the case.

### The microphone

![photo of microphone](./images/audio-setup/mic.jpg)

Obviously an important piece of equipment! The **Shure BETA 87a** is a [supercardioid](http://blog.shure.com/multi-pattern-microphones-what-where-and-how/) mic, which refers to how it picks up sound: It‚Äôs forgiving and blocks out ambient noise.

You can go crazy with mics, spending a huge amount for a smidge better sound quality. You might not use this mic to record a #1 banger, but it still fits into the "sounds very good" column. üëç

Positioning of the mic is important. You should be 2‚Äì6 inches away for optimal volume levels. For extra credit, here are loads more positioning tips:

![mic positions](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f4db11f477bd853b761ef449123534ae62dec1ac/68747470733a2f2f64337676366c703535716a6171632e636c6f756466726f6e742e6e65742f6974656d732f33743267323430423265323233473163316333752f53637265656e25323053686f74253230323031362d30392d30382532306174253230312e33372e3232253230504d2e706e67)

(We don‚Äôt really give out extra credit, but you might sound _slightly_ better.)

### Shock mount (right)

![photo of preamp and shock mount](./images/audio-setup/pre-amp-and-shock.jpg)

This little piece connects to the boom, and the microphone slides into it before being attached to the XLR cable. It will dampen any footsteps or other vibrations that might be picked up through the stand to the mic. (You‚Äôll most likely be sitting down, but who knows what your kids or roommates are up to.)

### USB audio interface (left)

The mic we‚Äôre giving you is built for professional audio applications, not necessarily for capturing audio on a computer. This interface connects the mic to your computer, and converts XLR analog signal into 1s and 0s for the computer to store. It has an XLR input (from the mic) and a USB output (to the computer).

Note:
‚ö°Ô∏è The 48v power button needs to be on!
‚ö°Ô∏è Turn the gain up!

### XLR cable

XLR is a plug used in professional audio applications. It isn't completely necessary since the pre-amp will plug directly into the microphone, but play around and see if it makes your sound more stable.

![XLR](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/77d44222dc0a0650ef799c95e716ee9d1aa44592/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f662e636c2e6c792f6974656d732f326933393371314a30483059314f3139325931452f496d616765253230323031362d30342d31392532306174253230312e33382e3539253230504d2e6a70673f763d3066656435333337)

Your final setup should look something like this:

![photo of setup all done](./images/audio-setup/full-set-up.jpg)

### Check audio input levels

Once your gear is set up, you'll need to check the audio input levels to make sure your gain is set properly. Here‚Äôs a lesson to help you:

<ResponsiveEmbed src="https://egghead.io/lessons/tools-prepare-to-record-screen-resolution-and-mic-check/embed" />

Ta-da! You‚Äôre ready to record.

# Record your lesson

Screencasting is one of those iceberg-like tasks: 90% of the work is behind the scenes. Only 10% is visible.

![iceberg](./images/ch4_s3_iceberg.png)

Recording your screencast is that 10%. You‚Äôve put tons of thought and time into your lesson scope, code example, and points you want to cover. What distinguishes your success in this final stage is high-quality technical tools. (And careful editing‚Äîthat‚Äôs next.)

### Video capture

egghead.io instructors are provided with whatever software licenses you need. Just #ask!

**On Windows**, the best option for video capture and editing is [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html).

**On a Mac**, the best options are [ScreenFlow](https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/) and [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html). Both provide editing features. We tend to prefer ScreenFlow for its standalone simplicity, as Joe Maddalone shows in the video show below, but the decision is completely yours.

[![](./images/04-screencasting-tips-how-joe-eggheads.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nlJ_wP9dPE&&index=5&list=PL219naRJXQKbQJ60WxsuGfTFv7_fvna51)

### Capturing audio

There are three ways to record your screencasts. Each is completely üëå

- All at once
- Audio first, video second
- Video first, audio second

**All at once** is arguably the simplest approach‚Äîjust type and record the screen. You don't have to think about the video and audio separately. You just have to think about them at the same time, which might be a lot to ask. Give it a try and see how it feels to you!

**Audio first** means you play back the audio and record your video to match. The trick here is remembering what is said when, so your mouse is ready to move where it needs to.

**Video first** means you narrate over video playback. It can be challenging to sync and get a natural feeling with narration. Like most things, it takes practice.

For more on audio, see our guide to [audio setup](/set-up-your-audio).

### Record one thought at a time

While you‚Äôre recording, do your editing-self a favor: Record in short, high-quality chunks, one thought at a time.

Think of your lesson as a series of paragraphs that take 20 seconds to record. **Between each, take a pause**. Doing this will help you avoid intense editing to move audio and video snippets around as you build your quilt-like final product.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/GJycRLp6zYGFq/giphy.gif)

When you record in chunks, you get better short takes. (You‚Äôre not trying to set a record for the longest unedited take here.) By pausing between each section, you can visibly see where you need to [ripple delete](/edit-your-lesson).

Need an example? Watch John Lindquist show how to record one thought at a time:

<ResponsiveEmbed src="https://egghead.io/lessons/tools-record-one-thought-at-a-time/embed" />

# Edit your lesson

Editing is your lesson‚Äôs critical last stop between you and your audience. It‚Äôs your quality filter.

### Ripple delete

‚ö°Ô∏èRipple delete is your greatest ally. ‚ö°Ô∏è It‚Äôs basically deleting the bad parts, a chunk of seconds at a time‚Äîlike that tangent you go on, that five-second period where you stammer over a word, and those dozens of ‚Äúumm‚Äùs and ‚Äúlike‚Äùs you had no idea you said so often. Ripple delete couldn‚Äôt be easier or more essential, and it‚Äôs available in both Camtasia and Screenflow. üôå

In the egghead lesson shown below, John Lindquist shows how he uses ripple delete to trim a video from 7:28 to 2:17. Yes, really.

<ResponsiveEmbed src="https://egghead.io/lessons/tools-edit-with-ripple-delete/embed" />

## ‚ö°Ô∏è speed up/slow down video

Sometimes you want to speed over some unimportant parts or slow down important parts. You can do this in a controlled percentage wide format in Screenflow ([instructions here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu4b-ECFAYk)).

Alternatively, you can do it interactively by holding down `Option` while dragging the edges of a clip to do the same thing. Sped up clips will show a :rabbit2: and slowed clips will have a :turtle:. This is handy for stretching or shrinking a clip to be a specific size, **and** you can do it with multiple clips at once.

![stretch clip time](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6764957/52251445-fb72e480-28a0-11e9-8b32-304670ce2e0e.gif)

## ‚ö°Ô∏è annotate video

You can annotate your videos with arrows and boxes by using the Annotations tool in the top right in the inspector pane.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6764957/52251395-ad5de100-28a0-11e9-9b18-e80056582711.png)

They act like regular video clips so you can fade them in and out, apply animations, etc.

### Editing with Premiere

In time, you can üí• kick it up a notch üí• with more sophisticated editing software like Adobe Premiere. Premiere has some significant advantages, but it also has a steep learning curve. We recommend starting simple, and leveling up to a non-linear editing system like Premiere later. If you‚Äôre interested, see how some of our advanced instructors use Premiere:

- [Editing with John Lindquist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YqhKP-yZzo&index=1&list=PL219naRJXQKbQJ60WxsuGfTFv7_fvna51)
- [Going through the process with JS Leonard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faINApx4-4g&list=PL219naRJXQKbQJ60WxsuGfTFv7_fvna51&index=2)
- [Voiceover and editing with Joel Hooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faINApx4-4g&list=PL219naRJXQKbQJ60WxsuGfTFv7_fvna51&index=2)

### The easiest way to edit is to capture it well

In traditional videography, ‚Äúin-camera editing‚Äù refers to the idea of capturing content so well, it doesn‚Äôt need to be edited much at all.

Your first few lessons will feel like a major effort to produce because you have to consider so many different things. You‚Äôre teaching complex concepts (web development) and learning complex concepts (screencasting) at the same time.

Believe us: You‚Äôll get better. And better. And better. Just keep practicing and keep recording.

Need help or advice? Please, #ask! You aren‚Äôt the first person to do this or struggle at it. Your coach and the other friendly folks on Slack were all in your shoes once, and now we‚Äôre here to help you succeed.

# Sharing your code

Playing around with code is critical to becoming a better web developer.

For every egghead lesson, we provide a concise, organized, readable code example below the lesson video in a runnable embed, using Plunker or a similar service. That way, egghead members can jump in right away.

Note: You should always record in a local environment using your favorite text editor, and then repurpose your code using Plunker or your service of choice. You do you!

### Using Plunker

Plunker allows us to embed even fairly complex apps as runnable examples, perfect for our learners to run with. There are two ways to use it:

- You‚Äôll typically use **Plunker‚Äôs public UI** and set up your code example there. For standalone lessons, feel free to just do this. It works great.
- Plunker also supports loading your code **directly into the embed via Github**. This is an amazing feature that allows us to version control the examples presented to the user. egghead can then handle maintenance on your examples and keep them updated and supported for a much longer time. :muscle:

Much as we love Plunker, there are cases where it just won‚Äôt work. In those cases, simply link to a GitHub repository.

### Link a Plunker embed to a GitHub repo

Linking a GitHub repository to Plunker is fairly simple and involves configuring the Plunker embed url. We start with https://embed.plnkr.co/ , which is the base embed url. To link to Github we configure the url by adding:

`https://embed.plnkr.co/github/{profile-name}/{repository}/{branch}``

`{branch}` can be replaced with `{tag|sha1}` depending on how your repo is set up. If your repo is set up with an example in individual folders, you can add that `/path` to the embed url.

[Here‚Äôs an example Github repo](https://github.com/eggheadio-projects/nlp-in-javascript-with-natural), which is divided into one folder per lesson.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/BN85gMdmTnjYqHeoEwsHzjtXWp-ihYBBQULZI4C6tz0jmyhGGTjnkHwEOiYqTMn3w28D7bvq9Lvgixz5QdBtQM8mfs7V1vfOgYiRQIaahBfd22lcHBqEqARyqgWhzPib478Gmgz2)

### Additional Plunker embed config

URL parameters can be added to affect how the embed presents itself. The most-used feature is showing specific files (the default being the index and preview). Add `?show=` to the end of the url with the various filenames separated by commas.

`https://embed.plnkr.co/github/eggheadio-projects/egghead-wikipedia-demo/angular-2-building`

You‚Äôll see a complex example of this [here](https://embed.plnkr.co/github/eggheadio-projects/egghead-wikipedia-demo/angular-2-building-an-instant-search-with-angular-2-combining-observables-with-flatmap?preview=plnkr.html&show=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts,preview).

If you want to go wild, [this gist documents](https://ggoodman.gitbooks.io/plunker/content/embed.html) quite a few additional parameters you can use.

### Build complex apps in Plunker

Before you go any further, **stop!** You don‚Äôt need to build apps in Plunker. egghead will do this for you. Just hit up @zac in Slack and we‚Äôll get to it.

...but if you‚Äôre the DIY type, this is actually pretty cool.

Plunker itself doesn‚Äôt support the node file system‚Äîimport and export statements in Plunker will not work. But it is possible to create an in-browser Typescript compiler. This is usually required for Angular lesson examples. Doing this takes a bit of set up, so hang in there!

Here‚Äôs what you do.

**1)** Install jspm on your local machine if it isn‚Äôt already. It‚Äôs an auto-configure systemjs tool:
`$ npm i -g jspm@beta`

**2)** Run in whatever dir pleases you:
`$ jspm init`

**3)** Select all the defaults given to you. Then run:
`$ jspm i npm:{package_you_want_to_install}`
For instance: `jspm i npm:data.task` This will give a verbose working example of the config file needed to achieve in-browser compiling.

**4)** After init is done, this is the barebones .html page you will need:

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QfBRAe4xp95hUC9bSIhOaSanvInun0erAoUtjBQTdZ9AldfSC_-aOj-2nv1gbCf28B3MXmQK46WI0ABJCBbP8FBwjY2F-c8nmWOr79KsqIWWw5QaD2TsX4-nWEbXUGBEeJGZd1aE)

**5)** You then need to create an `app.js` file in the `src` directory `src/app.js` . This file will contain the code you want to run. Any packages that are installed using
`jspm i npm:{package_you_want_to_install}` will create a `jspm_packages/npm/{package_you_want_to_install}@1.2.3.json` file.

**6)** ‚ö°Ô∏è Copy those contents. ‚ö°Ô∏è
The content will be placed in your `SystemJS.config` under the packages property as the package you installed. For instance:

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/8j8p214IkMmQBkcdc9Y8m4ctaHcRfZGMksRnYHJ3IOa0y0okvb6TE0gVjZu-8a0qL_S_XRFnayxS1ID9yEh_EYuIbum_Arlwriy9sFeIaCLiausO2wqcFmUwFnFPeLLo9V5_Y4T9)

**7)** Jspm will also give you a `jspm.config.js` file: Copy this file, with some slight modifications.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Vyby8a90s6HEJspKmtAsyx6rzK_G0t1lUUtehzkc_3S-7e6QealWhI-yuSpP8IAf65BGyGOTG73BbStHeuna8SI9OmRU6xjZnEcbfqdK6xhUpiZ4AK_3gVRdRFe0AqNk32fFGDsn)

Note that the `"baseURL":` property was changed from `/` to a `.`

Also note that
`"systemjs-babel-build": "npm:systemjs-plugin-babel/systemjs-babel-browser.js` **line was added under the** `map` property (nested in the `devConfig` property).

**8)** For Plunker apps, just add this script tag (in `index.html` ): `<scriptsrc="https://unpkg.com/systemjs@0.19.41/dist/system.src.js"></script>`

**9)** Then the two `SystemJS.config` objects can be added in their own script. Now you‚Äôre good to go!

Here‚Äôs [one last example of a Plunker embed](http://embed.plnkr.co/UxkIoIK9PEkaupwTInDE?show=script.js,preview) to send you on your way.

# Host a demo REST API

Want data to play around with in your next egghead lesson?

egghead co-founder and instructor extraordinaire John Lindquist set us up with a REST API using [swapi](https://swapi.co/) (The Star Wars API) and [json-server](https://github.com/johnlindquist/swapi-json-server). As long as you don‚Äôt openly endorse or promote swapi (or Star Wars), you‚Äôll have no issues with copyrights.

If you don‚Äôt have a need for any special configurations, you can spin up the server using [npx](https://github.com/zkat/npx).

npx ships with the latest versions of npm, so you probably already have it installed.

`$ npx https://github.com/johnlindquist/swapi-json-server`
`// --> http://localhost:3000`

üí• Presto. You‚Äôre now running a REST API using Star Wars data. üí•

### Build custom data for egghead lessons

Of course, you have endless options for building a REST API.

If your data needs to be unique for the lesson you‚Äôre crafting (there‚Äôs a lesson for that!)

John shows us how to generate a large dataset of JSON data:

<ResponsiveEmbed src="https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-creating-demo-apis-with-json-server/embed" />

### 100 random people

If 100 random people is enough for your data set, grab this gist: [100 people in JSON format](https://gist.github.com/johnlindquist/3a7d28dbf231c476d62dd3f481d7b1c5).

### Serve JSON locally

`json-server` will serve any JSON file we have ready.

`$ npm i -g json-server`

`$ json-server {data.json}`

You're good to go.

### Host a REST API

Zeit's [now](https://zeit.co/now) feature is a great way to host any application needing it.

You can use the now command with an app John set up:

`$ npm i -g now`
`$ now https://github.com/johnlindquist/swapi-json-server`

If this is your first time using now, there will be a small amount of setup, but overall it's a breeze.

There‚Äôs a lesson for that, too. Check out [Deploy Web Apps with Zeit Now](https://egghead.io/courses/deploy-web-apps-with-zeit-now) for an in-depth look at `now`. Watch it right now!

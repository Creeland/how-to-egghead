After we've worked together to create a proposal and you've got your example code completed, you will create a rough cut practice run through of your course.

You will use this rough cut as an opportunity to correlate the concepts, skills, and practices we discussed in the course proposal document with the actual process of building.

This is a free flowing, unedited, and casual exercise for practice and understanding of the course curriculum you are developing. We want to see the goals and concepts of your course touched on, understand the scope more clearly, and clearly identify decision points that make "teachable moments" for the learners that will eventually use this course to level up their skills.

## Structure

The rough cut should NOT be a series of prepared lessons, but instead an organized run through of building the example. When possible, call out the concepts and skills as they relate to the goals of teaching how to break components into smaller pieces and develop them individually. Narrate what you’re doing as appropriate, but don’t worry about editing out pauses, mis-speaking, etc.

## Next Step

After the rough cut video has been created and reviewed, we will collaboratively draft an outline for the course, then prepare for a live practice run for members to watch and provide feedback on.

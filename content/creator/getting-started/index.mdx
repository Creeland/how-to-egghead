There is a lot of work that goes into creating high-quality content that helps busy people meet their personal and professional goals.

It's hard. It's a different skill tree than programming computers, and often that is a surprise to folks when they first dip their toes into creating egghead content.

The good news is that it is a very learnable skill, and as an egghead content creator you will be treated to coaching and support to help you skip from newbie to badass as quickly as possible.

You're not alone!

## Why be an instructor?

We get it. The last thing you need is another commitment. (You probably see the word ‚Äúcommit‚Äù in your sleep.) Good news: egghead instructors have zero obligations. It starts as a lowkey side hustle that can seriously pay off.

</div>

### You get paid

egghead instructors [get paid](/getting-paid) every time a paying egghead member watches one of your published lessons. More accurately, we pay you monthly based on your views for the preceding month.

![03_eggo_raining_money](./images/illustrations/ch1_s1_eggo-raining-money.png)

The more content you publish, the more money you‚Äôre likely to make. 

### You‚Äôre an expert

You heard us! You‚Äôre an expert. egghead instructors aren‚Äôt necessarily senior developers or technology directors (though some are). They‚Äôre just people who love learning, sharing, and writing code. You‚Äôre an expert when you share knowledge other people are looking for. So share it!

### Cement your knowledge

Explaining something helps you understand it better. If you‚Äôre learning a new skill or framework, there‚Äôs no better way to nail it than to record yourself talking about it (and re-record and edit until the holes in your logic disappear). Pop quiz yourself and make some money while you‚Äôre at it.

### Make career moves

`egghead instructor` looks üíÖ on a resume. Published lessons are portfolio gold. egghead gives you a platform‚Äîand all you need to do is give your knowledge a voice. We‚Äôll amplify it for you.



### Get egghead.io access for life

Here‚Äôs a serious perk: Every egghead instructor gets a lifetime membership to egghead.io with access to all of our premium lessons and courses. That‚Äôs a lot of learning to do, with lots more to come.

### Work with good people

You should always do your due diligence before partnering with any organization. But we give you our word: egghead is a low-key company whose sole focus is making web developers better at what they do.

Most of us at egghead HQ are developers too, so we know how busy you are. [We‚Äôll support you](/meeting-your-coach), we won‚Äôt give you deadlines (seriously‚Äîyou produce content only when you want to), and we‚Äôll [pay you](/getting-paid) fairly and quickly.

egghead is the company we always wanted to work with, so we created it for ourselves and for all the smart, badass developers out there.

## Working with Your Coach

Your success as an instructor is the #1 priority at egghead‚Äîand we know success doesn‚Äôt come without support. You‚Äôll need some guidance to create the world-class screencasts our members expect. That‚Äôs why we pair you with an egghead coach right when you start.

Your coach will help you nail egghead style through ongoing support, feedback, and brainstorming. Got questions? #ask! Big stuff, little stuff, rough drafts, fire away.

![07_coach_gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/PAYR5Ar3XpJJu/giphy.gif)

Slack with your coach to:

- Brainstorm [lesson ideas](/what-should-you-teach)
- Solidify the theme, scope, and goals of a code example
- Get a second pair of eyes before uploading screencasts
- Talk through feedback
- Get answers on administrative stuff like contracts, equipment, etc.

Even after you‚Äôve published a few lessons, your coach is available whenever you need them.

Plus, you can reach out to egghead's founders John Lindquist (@john) and Joel Hooks (@joel) with any questions or concerns. John and Joel are 100% dedicated to you and the rest of the egghead instructors. Slack us!

## Communication

### Joining Slack

![05_slack_eggos](./images/ch1_s2_joining-slack.png)

Slack is where we communicate.

Once you‚Äôve [signed up](http://egghead.io/) for egghead and created your instructor profile, you‚Äôll receive an invitation to [our Slack channel](/egghead-on-slack). That‚Äôs where you can meet other instructors from all over the world, talk shop, and get all the support you need from the egghead team. As an instructor, you have access to the egghead Slack for life. Bring your best emoji game.

![06_emoji_lineup](./images/ch1_s2_emoji-lineup.png)

When you join Slack, we‚Äôll create your private instructor channel. That‚Äôs where we‚Äôll share feedback with you, hash out lesson ideas, and answer any questions you have.

When in doubt, Slack!

### Zoom

### Email

## Your first lessons. Just 30secs!


We want to help new instructors get the hang of egghead style as fast as possible. We know you won‚Äôt nail it right away‚Äîthat‚Äôs okay! That‚Äôs expected!‚Äîso instead of creating an entire lesson, we ask you to record a 30-second video first. That snippet will tell us plenty, and we‚Äôll be able to give you feedback on your [code example](/create-your-code-example), [instruction style](/how-to-instruct), and the [technical stuff](/screencasting-tips).

![08_30second_lesson](./images/ch1_s4_30sec.png)

### What we're looking for

Don't be too concerned about subject matter, audio, or video quality at this point. You want to dial in your:

- [basic instruction style](/how-to-instruct)
- [code example](/create-your-code-example)
- [screen dimensions](/prepare-your-screen-for-recording)
- [font sizes](/prepare-your-screen-for-recording)

![09_lesson_basics](./images/ch1_s4_lesson-basics.png)

Our [technical guide](/screencasting-tips) has you all the details you need to confidently press record. Think you have it figured out? Share a screenshot of your screen setup on [Slack](/egghead-on-slack).

### Pick a topic

...but of course, you‚Äôll need to cover something specific. Since your video isn't intended for publication, keep it simple. No need to solve the internet just to impress us! Just pick a topic other web developers would find interesting, in the language of your choice. Python, Ruby, Rust, whatever you‚Äôre feeling.

Some quick ideas:

![Bracket](./images/ch1_s4_icon-bracket.png) Adding elements to an array

![Star](./images/ch1_s4_icon-star.png) Using variables in JavaScript template strings

![Equals](./images/ch1_s4_icon-equals.png) Centering elements in a div

Need help? Hit us up in your private [Slack channel](/egghead-on-slack).

### Start with the code

![11_start_with_code](./images/ch1_s4_start-with-code.png)

Before you record your clip, create your [example](/create-your-code-example): a before and after of your concept explained in code. You might provide the code in two states with a small diff explaining at a glance what your 30 seconds will teach. For simple topics, the before might be a blank screen‚Äîtotally fine.

Need a gut check? Share your code on Slack using a [Github gist](/sharing-your-code).

### Hit record

You've got a topic. You've got the code. Your screen is setup and ready to go.

Now, you need to record your screen as you take your code from its start state to its _finished_ state. Be efficient! 30 seconds goes by fast.

Don't worry about it. Don't edit it. Don't fuss over it. Just let it start the conversation.

### Share your recording on egghead.io

You can upload your video by submitting an application on [egghead.io](http://egghead.io).

![gold_invitation](./images/ch1_s4_invitation.png)

**If we invited you to be an egghead instructor,** you‚Äôll then finish your egghead registration and be prompted to join Slack if you haven‚Äôt already.

We hope you‚Äôll turn this snippet into your first published lesson, or you might start fresh with a whole new topic. Either way, you‚Äôll come out of this exercise understanding the advantages to recording in small chunks with a tight feedback loop. And then you‚Äôll be ready to record for real.

## Feedback on Your Work: What to Expect

Think of your 30-second video as a very rough draft. It won‚Äôt be perfect‚Äîand it shouldn‚Äôt be! It‚Äôs a gut check to see how we can help steer you toward egghead style.

### Questions? Just #ask.

We‚Äôre here to help you. Before you record your video, use your private Slack channel to fire over any questions or works in progress, like:

- [**Lesson ideas**](/what-should-you-teach)**.** We can help you brainstorm or fine-tune an idea you have. (Chances are, we‚Äôll suggest you scale back the scope of your example. Your lesson should cover one topic and one topic only. No more, no less.)
- [**Your lesson title and summary**](/write-the-title-and-summary). These should be concise and hyper-focused. Before you write any code, make sure you‚Äôve chiseled your lesson idea until it‚Äôs simple and able to be tackled in a short video.
- [**A draft of your code example**](/create-your-code-example). Share it over screen sharing technology with your coach on Slack. Walk them through the steps it took to create the example, and think through any changes your coach suggests.

We‚Äôre all about supportive, ongoing feedback at egghead, so when you‚Äôre ready to press record, you‚Äôre _really_ ready.

![An illustration would work here too üôÇ](https://media1.giphy.com/media/111ebonMs90YLu/giphy.gif)

### Feedback

Before you upload your video to your slack channel (if we‚Äôve invited you to be an instructor), ask yourself:

- Is my screen set to 1280x720 (720p)? (In HiDPI, if possible?)
- Is my code example easy to understand?
- Did I guide the viewer‚Äôs eyes with the mouse?
- Did I use those 30 seconds to share useful insights?

We‚Äôll use those questions to guide our feedback, which we‚Äôll share with you over Slack.

After that, we may go through a few rounds of rerecording and feedback until we feel you‚Äôre ready to go off and record your first lesson.

Remember: We want you to succeed. We want you to absolutely crush it. Feedback‚Äîespecially right when you start with egghead‚Äîwill help you get there.

## You will sound **great**: The Gift of Pro Audio

If you‚Äôre looking at your laptop and wondering how you‚Äôll juke the microphone settings to create professional-quality sound quality...no need. We got you!

Once you've created a draft lesson that is _almost_ ready to be published, we‚Äôll ship you a case packed with audio recording toys. With our compliments, of course.

You‚Äôll get:

- K & M 23150-500-55 Tabletop Microphone Stand with 5/8" Threaded Connector and Mini Boom Arm
- Shure BETA 87A Microphone
- Shock Mount to attach the mic to the stand
- Shure X2U XLR-to-USB Signal Adapter
- 1 XLR Cable to connect the Microphone to the USB Interface
- Badass by Kathy Sierra

Our [technical guide](/set-up-your-audio) covers setup and how each item works.

## You will be paid for your content.

Yes! egghead instructors make money! You receive royalties for all the views your lessons and courses get.

How much you get paid can range from "lunch money" to "paying the bills!", and primarily varies with the quality and quantity of what you publish. [Courses](/course-production) take the most effort, but they also make the most money. Even a single lesson can net you rewarding royalties for a long time; with a keyword-rich summary and title, a lesson can surface in search engine results years after it‚Äôs published.

$$ BREAK TO DO THE MONEY DANCE $$

The best way to make money is to produce interesting, useful content. Quantity is good, but quality is better. Good content sells itself.

We don't produce sponsored content or run ads on a regular basis. It‚Äôs all about eyeballs. üëÄ

### How royalties work

Royalties are paid at the beginning of the month, and reflect how many 30-second segments viewers watched in the previous month. We use PayPal or direct deposit to distribute royalties.

![](https://media2.giphy.com/media/BZhxwIs7as5ngfbVSN/giphy.gif)

The amount you‚Äôre paid depends on the overall gross subscription revenue, and how many 30-second segments were watched in total. We use this basic algorithm in Ruby:

_egghead_monthly_revenue _ ( your*segments / total_segments ) * royalty*percent*

![royalty_crown](./images/ch1_s2_royaltycrown.png)

When you start making one-off lessons, the royalties will be small. But stick with it, keep producing, and your monthly royalties could hit four figures. Cha-ching.

### Make more money with courses

After you‚Äôve made a few standalone lessons and gotten the hang of egghead, you‚Äôll probably put on your entrepreneurial thinking cap. How can you leverage your new skills to make the cash flow?

_Courses are the bread and butter of egghead.io_. Developers looking to learn want curated chunks of information, and we‚Äôve found that they‚Äôre willing to pay for it. Grouped lessons are more likely to be found and watched than one-off lessons, making their royalties far greater than those of standalone lessons.

![](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_5039938F092F55E0495D77B9A65DAF41A0665506BE0DA505220FAFB13AF54251_1530308382885_image.png)

You won‚Äôt be crafting courses right out of the gate, but stick with it. The payoff is worth it.

### Keeping it up

Ongoing income is the best. But it takes ongoing work.

Many people create a lesson or two, then stop. There are a variety of reasons people stop making lessons:

- Way too freaking busy!
- It just isn't for me.
- It's hard AF.
- I can't think of what to record.
- The money‚Äôs not coming fast enough.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/D3ggX9iWqOHza/giphy.gif)

One of our primary motivations for creating egghead was to help smart humans get reliable recurring income by sharing their knowledge. This kind of income can change how you think of employment. If you're making \$1,000 a month from some content you made a year ago, what can that do for you? That's rent! (Unless you live in the Bay Area or NYC‚Äîsorry!) egghead royalties could be the difference between staying in a high-paying gig you hate and taking a position you truly love with an organization that can't afford talent of your caliber. How great would that be?

![piggy_bank](./images/ch1_s7_piggybank.png)

Hopefully you‚Äôre already in that position, but if not, we want to help you get there. We're totally obsessed, and will do everything we can to support and amplify our instructors. We're in this to have a job that we love, work with amazing, diverse people across the globe, and help people improve their lives by learning how to develop software.

If you want to create a sustainable passive income stream by creating useful learning content for fellow developers, stick with us. We‚Äôll make it happen for you.

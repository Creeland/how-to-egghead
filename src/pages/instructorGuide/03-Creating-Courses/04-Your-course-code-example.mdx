# Your course code example

A course typically has one code example that acts as a connecting thread through the course. You’ll build on it from lesson to lesson.

As soon as your course proposal is approved, you should start building your code example [in a tool like Plunker](/sharing-your-code). The best format of your code example will depend on [the style of your course](/how-to-structure-your-course). As always, #ask your coach for guidance and a second pair of eyes as you build.

### Sharing your code

For each lesson in a course, you’ll provide your code example in its finished state below the video so learners can explore the code on their own.

[Plunker](https://next.plnkr.co/) is our favorite tool for [creating and delivering our examples](/sharing-your-code). We also enjoy [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/). If they won’t work for the code you’re building, you can use a GitHub repository to store the code example. GitHub repo examples will provide a branch for each lesson, where the branch is the _finished_ state of the given lesson. If your course is the ["cookbook" style](/how-to-structure-your-course) and uses GitHub, you can just have folders in a single repo for each example.

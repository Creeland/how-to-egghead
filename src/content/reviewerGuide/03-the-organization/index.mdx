# Review Team Apps for Communication and Work

There are quite a few tools that we use at egghead that allow us to communicate, organize, and plan our thoughts and work. This section will explain how we use each tool and give you an understanding of why we use it.

After reading this section, you'll know how we communicate as a team at egghead and where work is done.

We'll cover:

- Github
- Slack
- Email
- Topic Box

## GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a website and service used to store and track the development of software. It does this through Git which the tool that actually keeps track and manages code.

GitHub is a hosting service for projects (repositories) that use Git. It's not the only service that does this but is widely accepted, especially in Web Development.

For more specifics on Git, visit our Prerequisite section [link to that].

## GitHub & the Review Team

GitHub is where we store code examples for the content that is created at egghead. Specifically, all code is stored under the [eggheadio-projects organization]([https://github.com/eggheadio-projects](https://github.com/eggheadio-projects)).

Each repository (with a few exceptions) in this organization will correlate to a course that has been or will be published on egghead.

## Asynchronous Communication

Because team members are spread across the globe, our primary form of communication is asynchronous. We use [Slack](https://slack.com/features) as the day to day tool for questions that need to be answered immediately as well as a place to post work, ask for reviews

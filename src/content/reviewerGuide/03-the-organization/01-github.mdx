## GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a website and service used to store and track the development of software. It does this through Git which the tool that actually keeps track and manages code.

GitHub is a hosting service for projects (repositories) that use Git. It's not the only service that does this but is widely accepted, especially in Web Development.

For more specifics on Git, visit our Prerequisite section [link to that].

## GitHub & the Review Team

GitHub is where we store code examples for the content that is created at egghead. Specifically, all code is stored under the [eggheadio-projects organization]([https://github.com/eggheadio-projects](https://github.com/eggheadio-projects)).

Each repository (with a few exceptions) in this organization will correlate to a course that has been or will be published on egghead.
